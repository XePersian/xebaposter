The xebaposter class
v2.1

The class is designed for making an academic poster. This work is a fork of 
baposter by Brian Amberg and Reinhold Kainhofer available at 
http://www.brian-amberg.de/uni/poster/.

The class should be used with bidi and xepersian packages,
because it uses some special environments and commands from these packages.

For more information, please see the documentation.
